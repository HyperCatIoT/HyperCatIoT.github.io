# HyperCat

HyperCat is an open, lightweight JSON-based hypermedia catalogue format for exposing collections of URIs. Each HyperCat catalogue may expose any number of URIs, each with any number of RDF-like triple statements about it. HyperCat is simple to work with and allows developers to publish linked-data descriptions of resources.

HyperCat is designed for exposing information about IoT assets over the web. It allows a server to provide a set of resources to a client, each with a set of semantic annotations. Implementers are free to choose or invent any set of annotations to suit their needs. A set of best practices and tools are currently under development. Where implementers choose similar or overlapping semantics, the possibilities for interoperability are increased.

## HyperCat Consortium

As of April 2015, HyperCat 2.0 is being developed by a broad consortium of companies. See http://hypercat.io for more information.

# Examples of using HyperCat

## HyperCat and SenML

HyperCat can point at any resource with a URL or URI. One common resource type (as used by the HyperCat Phase1 OpenIoT cluster) is SenML for representing time-series sensor data.

### SenML

SenML is a media type for representing simple sensor measurements and device parameters.
Representations are available for XML, EXI (Efficient XML Interchange) and JSON.
SenML is defined by http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jennings-senml-10

This examples uses just the JSON representation, `application/senml+json`.

Every valid SenML document is a JSON object with an array of event objects.

    {
      "e": [
      ]
    }

Each event object contains a name `n`, a value `v` and an optional timestamp `t` in seconds since 01/01/1970 (UNIX epoch).
Events may also contain a units `u` declaration.

Documents may contain a single event with no timestamp (considered to be a "live" value)

Here, our `n` value is a URI giving a unique identifier for this sensor and parameter. This is optional.

    {
      "e": [
        { "n": "http://example.org/sensor1/temperature", "v":22.5 }
      ]
    }

Documents may contain declarations of units according to the units registry in the SenML specification.

    {
      "e": [
        { "n": "http://example.org/sensor1/temperature", "u": "Cel", "v":22.5 }
      ]
    }

Documents may contain single or multiple timestamped events

    {
      "e": [
        { "n": "http://example.org/sensor1/temperature", "u": "Cel", "t": 1234, "v":22.5 },
        { "n": "http://example.org/sensor1/temperature", "u": "Cel", "t": 1235, "v":22.8 },
        { "n": "http://example.org/sensor1/temperature", "u": "Cel", "t": 1236, "v":22.2 }
      ]
    }

Or, events for multiple resources

    {
      "e": [
        { "n": "http://example.org/sensor1/temperature", "u": "Cel", "t": 1234, "v":22.5 },
        { "n": "http://example.org/sensor1/light", "u": "lm", "t": 1235, "v":135 },
        { "n": "http://example.org/sensor2/acidity", "u": "pH", "t": 1235, "v":7 }
      ]
    }

To shorten documents and improve readability, an optional base name (`bn`) may be given to be used as a prefix for all resource names. The following two documents are equivalent

    {
      "e": [
        { "n": "http://example.org/sensor1/temperature", "u": "Cel", "t": 1234, "v":22.5 },
        { "n": "http://example.org/sensor1/light", "u": "lm", "t": 1235, "v":135 }
      ]
    }

    {
      "e": [
        { "n": "temperature", "u": "Cel", "t": 1234, "v":22.5 },
        { "n": "light", "u": "lm", "t": 1235, "v":135 }
      ],
      "bn": "http://example.org/sensor1/"
    }

To shorten documents and improve readability, an optional base time may be given. All times `t` are deltas from the base time (`bt`). The following two documents are equivalent

    {
      "e": [
        { "n": "http://example.org/sensor1/temperature", "u": "Cel", "t": 1234, "v":22.5 },
        { "n": "http://example.org/sensor1/light", "u": "lm", "t": 1235, "v":135 }
      ]
    }

    {
      "e": [
        { "n": "temperature", "u": "Cel", "t": 0, "v":22.5 },
        { "n": "light", "u": "lm", "t": 1, "v":135 }
      ],
      "bn": "http://example.org/sensor1/",
      "bt": 1234
    }


#### SenML with HyperCat

HyperCat is a file format and API designed for discovery of resources by web clients.
Although data can be carried both by SenML resources and in HyperCat catalogues themselves, as a general guide - more static data (metadata) about assets should be in catalogues while sensor readings and rapidly changing values should be in SenML or other resources.

For example, a streetlight is (relatively) immobile so its geographic position should be carried in HyperCat metadata. However, its live power consumption is constantly varying over time and should be provided in a resource pointed to by the catalogue, such as SenML.

Conversely, a vehicle’s geographic position is constantly varying so should be carried in a resource, such as SenML. The license number, make and model of the vehicle could be carried in HyperCat metadata.

When SenML documents are listed in HyperCat, they use the metadata relation

    {"rel":"urn:X-tsbiot:rels:isContentType","val":"application/senml+json"}

When listing SenML resources in HyperCat, the HyperCat `href` link should point to the URL of a SenML document.

Individual resources in the SenML document may be named such that they are prefixed by the SenML document’s URL, either manually or by using the `bn` attribute. A data crawler is then able to relate the two from their paths.

Here follows an example catalogue and SenML document:

    {
        "item-metadata":[
            {
                "rel":"urn:X-tsbiot:rels:isContentType",
                "val":"application/vnd.tsbiot.catalogue+json"
            },
            {
                "rel":"urn:X-tsbiot:rels:hasDescription:en",
                "val":"Sensor example"
            }
        ],
        "items":[
            {
                "href":"https://example.org/sensor1",
                "i-object-metadata":[
                    {
                        "rel":"urn:X-tsbiot:rels:isContentType",
                        "val":"application/senml+json"
                    },
                    {
                        "rel":"urn:X-tsbiot:rels:hasDescription:en",
                        "val":"Sensor number one"
                    },
                    {
                        "rel":"http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#long",
                        "val":"-0.57"
                    },
                    {
                        "rel":"http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#lat",
                        "val":"51.23"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }


    {
        "e":[
            {"n":"temperature", "t":12345, "v":22.5, "u":"Cel"},
            {"n":"temperature", "t":12346, "v":22.7, "u":"Cel"},
            {"n":"temperature", "t":12347, "v":22.4, "u":"Cel"},
            {"n":"power", "t":12345, "v":100, "u":"W"}
        ],
        "bn":"https://example.org/sensor1/"
    }
